# Alarm Clock for Home Assistant

In the quest for a perfect Alarm Clock, I'm getting closer, thanks to home assistant.

This card was designed for a tablet which I use on my nightstand with a resolution of 1280px on 800px. 
The idea is to have a really minimalistic, readable clock with some Home Assistant love. 
The card exists out of two parts:

## Features
* the clock part (65%) of the height of the screen with:
  * the clock of course
  * the options to setup alarms
  * the option to override/update the next alarm
  * a nap timer option
* the lower part (35%) of the height of the screen which:
  * can show up to 3 other home-assistant cards
  * shows the snooze and dismiss button when the alarm is ringing


## Updates
* 2018-09-05: first beta release
