# Alarm Clock for Home Assistant

In the quest for a perfect Alarm Clock, I'm getting closer, thanks to home assistant.

This card was designed for a tablet which I use on my nightstand with a resolution of 1280px on 800px. 
The idea is to have a really minimalistic, readable clock with some Home Assistant love. 

## Screenshots love...

## Note:
- This card is still in beta and it scratches my own itch. No support/guarantees/.... It may eat your dog or the alarm may not go off and you can thus miss a date with the love of your live, ...
- I tried to solve the alarm in the backend using timers, ... but did not succeed due to some outstanding bugs. So, this means that the logic to *fire the alarm is in the frontend*. If you close your browser, it will not go off. But, since it was designed for an always on tablet (for me a Nexus 7 2013 which is always running and has this constantly open), it appears to work


## Features
The card exists out of two parts:
* the clock part (65%) of the height of the screen with:
  * the clock of course
  * the options to setup alarms
  * the option to override/update the next alarm
  * a nap timer option
* the lower part (35%) of the height of the screen which:
  * can show up to 3 other home-assistant cards
  * shows the snooze and dismiss button when the alarm is ringing
  
But wait, that's not all! It also integrates with:
* a holiday calendar so that when you have a holiday the next day, your alarm will automatically disable.
* the workday sensor so that when you have a holiday the next day, your alarm will automatically disable.

* When the alarm clock is ringing, the `input_boolean.alarm_clock_ringing` will be on, otherwise it will be off. Using it, one can do many automations like starting sonos, ... .

## Updates
* 2018-09-05: first beta release
